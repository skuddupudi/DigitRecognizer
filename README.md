This project contains code to predict the digit based on given picture data.

This is just an introduction to scikit-learn and other data minig concepts

I used the following classification algorithms :
1. KNN
2. Decision Trees
3. Logistic regrression
4. Naive Bayes classifier
5. SVM
6. Neural Networks

Data :
Taken from Kaggle dataset

Libraries used :
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. Scikit-learn

other improvements to be implemented :
1. reduction of features
    a. forward feature construction
    b. backward feature eleemination
    c. correlation matrix
    d. PCA
2. Random forest
3. Boosting - and xgboost
